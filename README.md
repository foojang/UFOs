**Overview**

We are working with Dana to create a website that tracks UFO sightings and allows users to filter the data. The Data can be filtered by “Date” “City” “State” “Country” and “Shape” We also want to make the website attractive and easy to use. 

**Results**

Below we have the website that is out intro and is attractive to users.

The data is unfiltered and is in chronological order and iseres can browse as they like.

We have five filters that can narrow down specific UFO sightings.

Users can use all five at once or pick individual search criteria. Below we have filtered by date and state.

**Summary**

One drawback of our search method is it does not allow for partial matches. For example if we search for fresno it returns one result. If we search for Fresno it returns zero results. The search function looks for exact matches only. 

I would recommend expanding the search function to identify partial matches or add a drop down menu of available cities. 

An enter and clear button would also be useful to make searching multiple criteria quickly and more user friendly.
